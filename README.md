# Print PDF
If I tried printing as PDF, then the title, page, date, etc... was not visible for printing to pdf. These are now commented out and not active.
I have a printHead and printFoot section just for PDF's. 
If you print to printer or OneNote then the title, page, date, etc... is visible by default.
